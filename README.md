# Missed/Broken FRX files

2) frmDataParkingIn.frx


FRX is a file extension for a form stash file format used by Visual Basic. 
FRX files store icons and graphics much like an FRM file. 
FRX files differ in that they only save binary data for forms created with Visual Basic.

1) frmDemo.frm				

- function "ArchiveCopy" not found

- object "frmTableInfo" not found
